Pymaceuticals Analysis

Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze drug treatment on tumor volume, metastasis and survival using the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib.
Create a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
Create a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic sites changes over time for each treatment.
Create a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate (%))
Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
